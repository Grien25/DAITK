# Decompiler Progression

This document outlines the incremental steps for building the AI-assisted decompiler. The goal is a simple command line pipeline that consumes assembly generated by `dtk-template`, produces C for each function, and verifies every result with `objdiff`.

## Stage 1 – Setup
- Accept a folder of `.s` files and corresponding original objects from Decomp-Toolkit.
- Organize outputs into `asm/`, `orig_obj/`, `recomp_obj/`, `src/`, and `logs/` directories.

## Stage 2 – Automated Decompilation
- For each assembly file, invoke an LLM to generate matching C code.
- Compile the generated C using the Metrowerks CodeWarrior PPC compiler.

## Stage 3 – Verification
- Compare the new object files against the originals using `objdiff`.
- Mark exact matches as verified and record any mismatches.

## Stage 4 – Refinement
- Iterate on prompts or manual tweaks to resolve mismatches.
- Continue until most functions compile to identical objects.

This progression removes earlier IDE concepts and focuses entirely on an automated, script-driven decompilation workflow.
