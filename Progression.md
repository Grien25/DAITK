# Decompiler Progression

This document outlines the incremental steps for building the AI-assisted decompiler. The goal is a simple command line pipeline that consumes assembly generated by `dtk-template`, produces C for each function, and verifies every result with `objdiff`.

## Stage 1 – Setup
- Use `decomp-toolkit` to split your binary and produce `.s` files.
- Launch the GUI with `python3 scripts/function_browser.py` to browse the `asm/` folder. The browser loads files asynchronously and shows a progress bar while scanning. Select a file to view its functions in a second table and double-click a function to open the assembly.
- Create empty `recomp_obj/`, `src/`, and `logs/` folders for later stages.

## Stage 2 – Automated Decompilation
- For each assembly file, invoke an LLM to generate matching C code.
- Compile the generated C using the Metrowerks CodeWarrior PPC compiler.

## Stage 3 – Verification
- Compare the new object files against the originals using `objdiff`.
- Mark exact matches as verified and record any mismatches.

## Stage 4 – Refinement
- Iterate on prompts or manual tweaks to resolve mismatches.
- Continue until most functions compile to identical objects.

This progression removes earlier IDE concepts and focuses entirely on an automated, script-driven decompilation workflow.
