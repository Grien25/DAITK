# Platform Progression

This project aims to build a user-friendly VSCode Extension for decompilation workflows, starting with tooling integration and evolving toward advanced AI features.

## Stage 1 – Dtk Template Integration
- Build a launcher that allows users to create a dtk-template in a user's documents folder.
- VSCode will then blip to the folder it just created.
- Create a walk through telling users what they need to edit in order to get started with dtk-template (read dtk-docs/Getting_started.md).
- 

## Stage 2 – OBJDiff Visualization
- Integrate OBJDiff into the VSCode extension for object file comparison.
- Enable users to select functions and view detailed diffs between original and recompiled objects.
- Show assembly and object-level differences in a clear, interactive format.

## Later Stage – AI Integration
- Incorporate AI models for automated decompilation and code refinement.
- Allow users to generate C code from assembly using LLMs, with options to review and edit results.
- Integrate AI-assisted suggestions and auto-fix tools for mismatches.

Each stage builds on the previous, moving from basic workflow support to advanced automation and AI-powered features.
