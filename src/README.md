# DAITK VSCode Extension

This extension provides basic helpers for Stage 1 of the project workflow.

- **Create dtk-template**: copies the template located in this repository to your `Documents/dtk-template` folder and opens it in VSÂ Code.
- **Show Getting Started Guide**: opens `dtk-docs/getting_started.md` in a Markdown preview.

A short walkthrough is included and will open automatically after the template is created.

## Running

Open this folder in VS Code and press F5 to launch an Extension Development Host. Then run **DAITK: Create dtk-template** from the Command Palette to set up the project.
