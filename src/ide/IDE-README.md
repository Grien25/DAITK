# IDE Prototype

A lightweight interface for running the decompilation workflow.
The initial version focuses on Stage 1: extracting assembly and
original objects using `decomp-toolkit`.

See `frontend/gui.py` for the Tkinter-based launcher. Future stages
will expand this GUI to show diff views and integrate the AI backend.
