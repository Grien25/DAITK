# DAITK VS Code Extension

This extension adds a custom sidebar for running common DAITK project actions.

## Features

- Activity bar icon labelled **DAITK**.
- Sidebar view with buttons to create or import projects.
- Links to documentation sections.

The functionality is intentionally minimal and can be expanded by
modifying `src/extension.ts`.
