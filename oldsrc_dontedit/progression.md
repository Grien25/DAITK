# Platform Progression

This project aims to build a user-friendly platform for decompilation workflows, starting with tooling integration and evolving toward advanced AI features.

## Stage 1 – Dtk Template Integration
- Build a launcher or GUI that makes it easy to run Decomp-Toolkit (dtk-template) workflows.
- Provide simple controls for splitting binaries, managing function lists, and viewing outputs.
- Allow users to configure paths, compiler versions, and other settings from the app.

## Stage 2 – OBJDiff Visualization
- Integrate OBJDiff into the platform for object file comparison.
- Enable users to select functions and view detailed diffs between original and recompiled objects.
- Show assembly and object-level differences in a clear, interactive format.

## Stage 3 – IDE Features
- Add code navigation, syntax highlighting, and editing for C and assembly files.
- Support project-wide search, file browsing, and quick access to function metadata.
- Provide build and diff controls directly in the IDE interface.

## Stage 4 – AI Integration
- Incorporate AI models for automated decompilation and code refinement.
- Allow users to generate C code from assembly using LLMs, with options to review and edit results.
- Integrate AI-assisted suggestions and auto-fix tools for mismatches.

Each stage builds on the previous, moving from basic workflow support to advanced automation and AI-powered features.
